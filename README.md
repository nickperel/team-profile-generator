# Challenge 10: Object Oriented Programming Challenge: Team Profile Generator

## Description

This week, I was given starter code and was tasked with creating a Professional README Generator from the command line only using Node.js. Using inquirer, this application should prompt the users for information regarding the project that they would like to generate the README file for, inlcuding the project title, description, installation instructions, usage instructions, license options to choose from, how to contribute, how to run tests, and a section for further questions. The README created should also have a functioning table of contents feature as well.
