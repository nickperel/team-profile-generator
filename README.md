  ## Description
  
  * This week I was not given any starter code and was challenged with creating a node.js command-line application that will use inquirer to receive user input regarding their team and then generate a webpage that reflects that data. This application was also required to have unit tests for each different employee type and was required to pass all tests as well. Upon starting the application from the command line, the user will be asked about the manager of their team, including what their name is, what their employee ID is, and what their email address is. Uniquely for the manager, they will be asked for their office number. Then, the user will be presented with a choice to add another team member, whether that be an engineer or intern, or they will be able to select the option that states that they're done building their team. When adding an engineer or intern, the user is asked for their names, employee ID, and emails as well, but they each have a unique aspect that they are asked about as the last question. For engineers, they will be asked for their github username, and for interns, they will be asked which school they attend. Once the user indicates that they are finished building their team, a message will appear that clarifies that the HTML file was successfully generated based on the user input. On the generated page itself, the email and the github parts should both have functioning links attached to them that leads the user to the desired place upon clicking those links.
